The project is not well-written, please suggest improvements to the project. However, be careful what you choose to refactor as this may take a lot of your time.

The project contains two modules:

* "compose" uses Jetpack Compose, please select this module if you are comfortable writing compose code
* "xml" uses more traditional XML layouts, please select this module if you are more comfortable using XML layouts

Think about:
* Architecture
* Android guidance
* Performance
